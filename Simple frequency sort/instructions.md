In this Kata, you will sort elements in an array by decreasing frequency of elements. If two elements have the same frequency, sort them by increasing value.

```
solve([2,3,5,3,7,9,5,3,7]) = [3,3,3,5,5,7,7,2,9]
--we sort by highest frequency to lowest frequency. If two elements have same frequency, we sort by increasing value
```

More examples in test cases.

Good luck!
