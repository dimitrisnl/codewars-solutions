Peter can see a clock in the mirror from the place he sits in the office. When he saw the clock shows 12:22
He knows that the time is 11:38

in the same manner:

```
05:25 --> 06:35

01:50 --> 10:10

11:58 --> 12:02

12:01 --> 11:59
```

Please complete the function WhatIsTheTime(timeInMirror), where timeInMirror is the mirrored time (what Peter sees) as string.

Return the real time as a string.

Consider hours to be between 1 <= hour < 13.

So there is no 00:20, instead it is 12:20.

There is no 13:20, instead it is 01:20.
